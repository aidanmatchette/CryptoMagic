# CryptoMagic
### Description
Crypto Magic is a fun and modern cryptocurrency dashboard and portfolio tracking web application. This app was built using **React.js** to provide a modern and palatable UI and UX experience. To handle data, from users and APIs, Crypto Magic used **Django Rest Framework** and a **PostgreSQL** database. Upon creating an account and getting authenticated, users are able to create as many portfolios as they desire. They can navigate to the dashboard where they will be able to see the top 10 trending cryptocurrencies, as well as 100 common coins. To get more in depth information, a user can select a specific coin. They will be redirected to a coin information page, displaying prices, percent change, coin description and a chart that accurately provides a visual display of the coins performance over (1 year, 1 month, and 1 day). From the coin information page, a user can add that coin to one of their created portfolios. Every page is able to display coin information in multiple different currencies.
### Why Crypto Magic
I chose to create a crytpocurrency web app to showcase my knowlege of React.js hooks and to gain a further understanding of developing full stack applications.
